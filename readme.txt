== Changelog ==

= 0.2.0 =
* WordPress 7.0 compatibility: read the API key from the core Connectors option (`connectors_ai_elevenlabs_api_key`, Settings > Connectors)
* WordPress 7.0 compatibility: move the xi-api-key authentication restore hook to init priority 21, after core's Connectors credential pass (init 20) which overwrites provider auth with generic Bearer authentication
* Fix API key validation on the WordPress 7.0 Connectors page: the availability check now also considers the registry request authentication and the Connectors/legacy credential options, instead of only the ELEVENLABS_API_KEY environment variable or constant

= 0.1.2 =
* Fix issue if API key not yet set in options table

= 0.1.1 =
* Fix API key registration, if the API key is not set in constant, but in the connectors page in WordPress admin
* Add a workaround to restore ElevenLabs authentication when the AI client initiation overwrites it with default auth.
